LinkRest
=========

LinkRest is a server-side Java REST framework for easy access to data stores. Its goal is to simplify backend interaction of client applications, such as a JavaScript apps or a native mobile apps. It is closely integrated with [JAX-RS 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services) REST containers and minimizes the amount of the server-side code needed to expose your data.

LinkRest was origianlly written with Sencha/ExtJS clients in mind, but it is not specific to a any single client technology. It can be used from iOS and Android applications, jQuery, etc.

LinkRest is written on top of [Apache Cayenne ORM](http://cayenne.apache.org/) and supports any relational data store. Alternative data stores can be provided with relative ease for NoSQL databases, flat files, etc.
